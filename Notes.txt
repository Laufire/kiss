Goal
{

	To build a simple and powerful framework that enables "truly" rapid development.
	
	It shold work well with other libraries; as the goal is to design a host for plugins (mainly UI controls).
	
	The learning curve should be very small; as unwanted complexity might hurt the agility.
	
	Meassures
	{
		Should support bootstrap.
	}
}
	
Questions
{

	Could html be automatically injected for collections without thee needed mark-up in the document?
	
	Could custom tag names be used to identify the class of the objects. Like: <Collection> <Item> <ScrollBar> etc?

	Could the tag name be used to identify objects instead of their ids?
	
	Could the global object of the library be $_$ or O_O to represent a kiss?
	
	How does a spreadsheet acieve data bindings.?
}

Noted
{
	HTML's Custom tag names appear to be case insensitive.
}

Known Issues
{
	Have to find a way to hide the content still rendering finishes.
	
	This is a proof of concept. So it has to be checked for performance issues, memory leaks etc.
