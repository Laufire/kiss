## Notes

* This script is not portable, as it needs **a specific DB**.
* The server side scripts or written on PHP. They act as a bridge to a MySQL DB; which executes procedures and return the result to PHP. PHP than pumps  it back to the client.
* **jQuery**, is used to achieve scrolling.
* **require.js**, is used to load modules dynamically.
