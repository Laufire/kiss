# kiss.js AutoComplete
#### an example plugin (kiss v0.0.7)

## Notes

* This is an example plugin, it could be written more efficiently.
* The plugin doesn't have any styles, so not to interfere with the styles of the host.
* Styling would be more easy, if the plugin could support custom tags.
* By default plugins do not replace their placeholder elements (as it might mess the host); but could be designed so by implementing a $.at method.
