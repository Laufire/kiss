# Kiss.js TodoMVC Example
Thanks to: [Addy Osmani](https://github.com/addyosmani) for the UI.

## History

* 131228_1030: state-handling has been rewritten to adopt new changes to kiss.

## Issues

* **Fixed:** Filters are applied after the content is rendered, this causes a glitch that shows the filered-out items.

## Learned

* Building a real app helps
	* To fix bugs and implement new features in the framework.
	* To understand and internalize the framework.
	* To understand how the community could help in building a framework (lots of usage and testing makes the framework mature).

## Notes

* The **inline usage of O_O.trans** discovered.
* Async module loading delays the inital load, but it too helps with spotting the 'loading glitches'.
