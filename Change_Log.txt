140105_1930 Bug fixed. .order of .list and .pod had type conversion errors (string <-> int); for type safety the have to be strings.
140105_2045 event dispatching in .box.default tweaked.
140105_2140 Bug fixed. .list's model.id-s weren't type safed.
140105_2255 .list.add needs a model as it's paramter; it could assign an id to the model if an id isn't present in the paramater.
